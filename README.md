## Description
This application is a functioning book search engine which allows the user can search for books by title. Users also have the option to create an account, and when logged in have the option to save books to a personal list. The application uses MongoDB, Mongoose, and GraphQL on the back end and React to render the front end. The application was originally designed to use RESTful API routes, but was refactoring to instead use GraphQL.
